* File: CST116-Ch10-Debugging.cpp
*
* General Instructions: Complete each step before proceeding to the
* next.
*
* Debugging Exercise 1
*
* 1)	Build and run the program.
* 2)	Examine the code and the output and notice the use of
*	parallel arrays.
* 3)	Insert breakpoints at Breakpoint 1, Breakpoint 2, and Breakpoint
*	3.
* 4)	Run to Breakpoint 1.
* 5)	Place a watch on varX, varY and varZ.  Click on the '+' in the
*	watch window to see the individual elements associated with each
*	of the arrays.
* 6)	Continue running your program to Breakpoint 2.
* 7)	Add a watch on the array called name.  Again, click on the '+'
*	symbol.  Notice how a multidimensional array is shown in the
*	debugger, the null terminating characters location, and how a
*	character is represented within each element of the array.
* 8)	Continue running the program to Breakpoint 3.
* 9)	Notice the contents of varX and varY now that you are back in the
* 	main function.
* 10)	Clear all the breakpoints.
* 11)	Stop debugging.
*
* Debugging Exercise 2
*
* 1) 	Change the constant SIZE from 5 to 10.
* 2) 	Change any literal containing a 5 to the constant SIZE.
*     Notice the usefulness of the constant when changes need
*     to be made to your code.
* 3) 	Set a breakpoint at Breakpoint 4. Now on this breakpoint
*  	set the necessary condition so the loop breaks when x hits 8.
*	(Hint:  If you need help setting breakpoints based upon a
*	condition refer to Chapter 8).
* 4)  Run to Breakpoint 4.
* 5)	Continue stepping into the remainder of the for loop until the
*	flow returns back to main.
* 6) 	Make sure your Watch window is visible and notice the contents
* 	of varY and varZ now that you are back in main.
* 7) 	Stop debugging.
* 8) 	Disable all breakpoints.
* 9)	Rebuild and execute the program and verify the results.
*
* Debugging Exercise 3
*
* 1)	Just before the call to the PrintFunction in main, add an
*	assignment statement to change the first element in the
*	array varZ to -99.
* 2)	Build and execute your code, verifying that the calculations
*	are correct in relation to element 0 of varZ.
* 3)	Add a line to assign the contents of the second element of
*	varX to 99 in FunctionTwo.
* 4)  Rebuild your program.
* 5	Obviously there is a problem.  Remove the const from the
*     function declaration and header for varX.
* 5)	Now you should be able to build and execute your code.  Do it.
* 6)	Set a breakpoint on Breakpoint 2.
* 7)	Re-enable Breakpoint 2.
* 8)  Run to Breakpoint 2 and make sure you have a watch on the
*	variable name.
* 9)	Click on the '+'.  Once you see all the elements
*	within the array, change the 'Value' (in the Value field)
*	for the first element of the array directly within the Watch
*	window to the character 'Z'.  Notice how the value is updated
*	by displaying the new ASCII value too.
* 10)	Stop debugging.
* 11)	Disable all breakpoints.
